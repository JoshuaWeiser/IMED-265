            The first coffee machine was created in France in 1822 by Louis Bernard Rabaut.
            In 1855, another Frenchman, Edouard Loysel de Santais, presented a caf√© express machine able to make 2,000 cups of coffee in one hour, however the machine did not use steam to directly force water through the coffee and it apparently brewed coffee into a pot.
            <br><br>
            Angelo Moriondo is often erroneously credited for inventing the beverage, since he patented a steam-driven coffee beverage making device in 1884 (No. 33/256), probably the first Italian coffee machine similar to other French and English 1800s steam-driven coffee machines. The device is "almost certainly the first Italian bar machine that controlled the supply of steam and water separately through the coffee" and Moriondo is "certainly one of the earliest discoverers of the expresso machine, if not the earliest".
                <br><br>
            Seventeen years later, in 1901, Luigi Bezzera, from Milan, devised and patented several improved versions of the coffee machine, the first of which was applied for on 19 December 1901. Titled "Innovations in the machinery to prepare and immediately serve coffee beverage"; Patent No. 153/94, 61707, was granted on 5 June 1902, and was the first espresso machine. In 1903, the patent was bought by Desiderio Pavoni, who founded the La Pavoni company and began to produce the machine industrially, manufacturing one machine daily in a small workshop in Via Parini, Milan.
